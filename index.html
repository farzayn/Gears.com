<p>Each of these gears are $ 9.99
  
</p>

<p>Chose your payment method : Visa, Apple Pay, and Paypal.</p>
<p> For your information we do not accept : Mastercard, Google Pay, and Stripe.</p>
<p> We are extremly sorry if you were not able to buy our gear because of the payment method limitation.

   We will be shortly adding the payment methods that were not included and some new payment methods as well.
